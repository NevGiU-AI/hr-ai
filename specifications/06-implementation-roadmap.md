# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 0 - Resolve foundations

- [ ] Decide Telegram, WhatsApp, or both.
- [ ] Finalize the composite scoring formula and individual weights.
- [ ] Define authentication, roles, organization boundaries, and audit requirements.
- [ ] Define candidate consent, retention, deletion, and data-residency policies.
- [x] Define the currently supported CV formats and upload limits (PDF, ZIP, 20 MB per file, 100 MB per request).
- [x] Establish the initial typed API error format and environment configuration.
- [x] Implement CI, immutable container publication, automatic staging deployment, and staging validation aliases.
- [x] Provision and harden separate staging and production VPSs with environment-specific keys and credentials.
- [x] Configure production Premium VPS backup and prepare private cross-region Object Storage.
- [ ] Complete production observability, off-server log collection, redaction, and alerting standards.
- [ ] Complete encrypted PostgreSQL backup automation and an isolated restoration test.
- [ ] Finish production release-promotion validation; GitHub environment protection, approval, and image rollback are configured.
- [ ] Confirm all development, staging, production, and backup credentials are isolated, rotated when needed, and absent from Git.

**Exit condition:** Product, security, and scoring decisions are documented and testable.

## Phase 1 - Stabilize job-offer generation

- [x] Review the backend and frontend job-offer flows against the feature specification.
- [x] Implement generation, edit, regeneration, approval, persistence, and listing behavior.
- [x] Add prompt-level missing-information and inclusive-language guidance.
- [x] Add initial frontend and backend unit/component coverage.
- [ ] Version request, response, prompt, and persistence schemas.
- [ ] Add direct approval, job details, lifecycle maintenance, and production-grade failure handling.
- [ ] Add controller integration and full end-to-end coverage.
- [ ] Measure latency and draft acceptance/edit rates.

**Exit condition:** A recruiter can generate, review, edit, approve, save, and reopen a job offer reliably.

## Phase 2 - Complete CV ingestion and evaluation

- [x] Implement guarded PDF, ZIP, and built-in CV upload pipelines.
- [x] Extract PDF text and conservatively infer candidate name and email.
- [x] Implement all eight validated metrics and an AI explanation.
- [x] Implement validated per-request weight configuration in the backend API.
- [x] Build candidate/job selection and current evaluation-result UI.
- [ ] Store original CV binaries behind a governed storage abstraction.
- [ ] Add OCR, metadata correction, and document reprocessing.
- [ ] Add metric-level evidence and separate reliability confidence from candidate fit.
- [ ] Expose approved weight configuration in the frontend.
- [ ] Persist prompt, model, weights, source-document version, and evaluation audit history.
- [ ] Build candidate details, ingestion history, and evaluation history UI/API.
- [ ] Validate scoring consistency, bias controls, and adversarial inputs.

**Exit condition:** Uploaded candidates receive explainable, reproducible, human-reviewable evaluations.

## Phase 3 - Add semantic indexing and web chat

- [ ] Add the backend vector-store integration; the PostgreSQL image supports pgvector, but CV chunking, embeddings, indexing, and retrieval are not implemented.
- [ ] Create embeddings and index CV chunks with authorization metadata.
- [ ] Implement retrieval, filtering, candidate detail, and comparison tools.
- [ ] Persist scoped conversation memory.
- [ ] Build the Angular chat interface and structured result cards.
- [ ] Add citations, clarification, injection defenses, and evaluation tests.

**Exit condition:** Authorized users can reliably find and compare candidates through the web chat with evidence-backed answers.

## Phase 4 - Build the dashboard

- [ ] Define metric semantics and freshness targets.
- [ ] Implement aggregate APIs and database indexes.
- [ ] Build filterable dashboard widgets and drill-down navigation.
- [ ] Add near-real-time updates and resilient UI states.
- [ ] Add evidence-backed AI insights.
- [ ] Validate accessibility, usability, and the 3-second target.

**Exit condition:** Recruiters can monitor roles and candidate evaluations and reach source records from every aggregate view.

## Phase 5 - Publish backend Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

This phase starts after the dashboard is complete so the documented API includes the stable job-offer, CV, evaluation, chat, and dashboard contracts rather than an incomplete surface.

- [ ] Add and configure Springdoc OpenAPI for the Spring Boot backend.
- [ ] Document every supported endpoint, request model, response model, validation rule, and HTTP status.
- [ ] Document the shared API error contract and provide safe example payloads without candidate personal data or credentials.
- [ ] Describe authentication and authorization requirements after the production security model is finalized.
- [ ] Group APIs by business capability and add operation summaries suitable for frontend and integration developers.
- [ ] Expose Swagger UI in local development and approved non-production environments; make production exposure an explicit security decision.
- [ ] Add automated validation that the OpenAPI document is generated and that critical endpoints remain represented.
- [ ] Publish or export the versioned OpenAPI document for consumers and keep it synchronized with releases.

**Exit condition:** Backend consumers can discover and test the stable API through reviewed, versioned, security-conscious Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.

## Phase 6 - Add external messaging

- [ ] Implement the selected provider behind a channel-neutral messaging interface.
- [ ] Link messaging identities to authenticated application users securely.
- [ ] Reuse the same authorization, retrieval, and conversation services as web chat.
- [ ] Minimize sensitive candidate data in messages and links.
- [ ] Add provider signature validation, rate limiting, retry, and audit logging.

**Exit condition:** External chat has security and answer quality equivalent to the web channel.

## Phase 7 - Release readiness

- [ ] Run full unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security test suites.
- [ ] Verify backup, restore, retention, deletion, and incident procedures.
- [ ] Add model, token, latency, error, retrieval-quality, and cost monitoring.
- [ ] Conduct recruiter acceptance testing with representative workflows.
- [ ] Document deployment, rollback, support, and model-change procedures.

**Exit condition:** Operational, security, AI-quality, and product owners approve release.

## Definition of done for every feature

- [ ] Requirements and acceptance criteria are agreed.
- [ ] API and data contracts are documented.
- [ ] Authorization and privacy behavior are tested.
- [ ] AI output is explainable and low-confidence behavior is explicit.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass.
- [ ] Relevant end-to-end flow passes.
- [ ] Error, empty, timeout, and retry states are handled.
- [ ] Logs and metrics support diagnosis without exposing candidate data.
- [ ] User documentation is updated.

# HR AI Recruitment Manager

An AI-assisted recruitment application for generating job offers, evaluating candidates, and managing recruitment workflows.

## Repository Transfer (August 1st, 2026)

We started working on this project for the 1st Edition of [KLx, Crédit Agricole Group's Hackathon.](https://www.klx.pt/) 

https://github.com/hack6nov2025/nevgiu-hr-ai -> NevGiU AI Org https://github.com/NevGiU-AI/hr-ai .

## Technology stack

- Angular frontend served by Nginx
- Spring Boot backend running on Java 21
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector
- Spring AI with OpenAI
- Docker Compose for local development

## Docker Compose file responsibilities

The repository deliberately has two active Compose contexts:

| File | Environment | How it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local development | Docker Compose selects it automatically when `docker compose ...` runs from the repository root. It builds the local frontend and backend and publishes development ports. |
| `deploy/compose.yml` | Staging and production | GitHub Actions copies this deployment bundle to each VPS, and `deploy/deploy.sh` runs it with environment-specific secrets and immutable container images. |

There is intentionally no root `docker-compose.prod.yml`. The previous file was obsolete and bypassed the current Caddy, private-network, health-check, immutable-image, and rollback design. Do not recreate or use a separate root production Compose path; make shared VPS deployment changes in `deploy/compose.yml` and keep environment differences in each VPS `.env` file.

## Run locally with Docker

### Prerequisites

Install and start:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Docker Compose, included with current Docker Desktop versions

Verify that Docker is ready:

```bash
docker info
docker compose version
```

### 1. Clone and enter the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

Use the HTTPS or SSH URL shown by the **Code** button on the current GitHub repository. This keeps the instructions valid if the repository is transferred or renamed.

### 2. Configure local secrets and the first administrator

Copy the safe template to the ignored local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and provide private local-development values:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
APP_SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@localhost
APP_SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<local-only password of at least 12 characters>
APP_SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_ORGANIZATION=local
APP_SECURITY_SECURE_COOKIE=false
APP_SECURITY_SESSION_TIMEOUT=30m
APP_REDIS_HOST=localhost
APP_REDIS_PORT=6379
APP_REDIS_PASSWORD=local-redis-secret
APP_REDIS_SESSION_NAMESPACE=hr-ai:session:local
```

The OpenAI key is passed to the backend container and is required for AI job-offer generation. The bootstrap credentials create the first local `ADMIN` account; the password is stored in PostgreSQL only as a bcrypt hash. Do not reuse staging or production credentials locally. Do not commit `.env` or expose its values in logs, screenshots, or chat.

CV ingestion and text extraction do not call OpenAI. An API key is required only when generating a job offer or explicitly evaluating a candidate against an approved job.

### 3. Build and start the application

From the repository root, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build can take several minutes because Docker downloads the Node, Maven, Java, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Redis dependencies.

### 4. Check service status

```bash
docker compose ps
```

The `db`, `redis`, `backend`, and `frontend` services should be running. PostgreSQL and Redis should report `healthy`, and the backend may briefly report `health: starting` while Spring Boot initializes.

Check backend health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"UP"}
```

### 5. Open the application

- Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
- Authentication API: [http://localhost:8080/api/auth/csrf](http://localhost:8080/api/auth/csrf)
- Backend health: [http://localhost:8080/actuator/health](http://localhost:8080/actuator/health)
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5433`

Sign in through the frontend with the local bootstrap email and password. Jobs, candidates, evaluations, and other business APIs require the authenticated browser session and are expected to return `401` when opened anonymously.

After the first successful login, remove this line from local `.env`:

```env
APP_SECURITY_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=...
```

Recreate only the local backend:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate backend
```

Sign in again with the same password. The account remains in the persisted local PostgreSQL data and the backend no longer receives the plaintext bootstrap password. Rebuilding containers does not reset this account. Changing the bootstrap password later does not update an existing user; password administration is a separate planned feature.

The PostgreSQL container listens on port `5432` inside the Docker network and is exposed as `5433` on the host to avoid conflicts with another local PostgreSQL instance.

## Deployment domains

HR AI is hosted under the `hr` project namespace of `nevgiuai.com`:

| Environment | Frontend | Backend API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | `https://hr.nevgiuai.com` | `https://api.hr.nevgiuai.com` |
| Staging | `https://staging-hr.nevgiuai.com` | `https://staging-api.hr.nevgiuai.com` |

Local development continues to use `http://localhost:4200` and `http://localhost:8080`. Deployment DNS records, TLS routing, GitHub environment URLs, frontend builds, backend CORS origins, and smoke tests must use the environment-specific domains above.

## Complete recruitment workflow

1. Open **Generate job**, enter a role description, and generate a job-offer draft.
2. Review the draft. Select **Edit**, make any required changes, and approve it. Only approved jobs are persisted and available for candidate evaluation.
3. Open **CVs & Evaluation**.
4. Import one PDF, a ZIP archive, or the packaged built-in CV dataset.
5. Select an imported candidate and an approved job, then select **Evaluate candidate**.
6. Review the overall fit score, eight individual metrics, and AI explanation. Scores are decision-support information and do not replace human review.

Uploading a CV never starts an evaluation automatically. This makes ingestion reusable and prevents unexpected model calls: the same candidate can be evaluated against different approved jobs.

### CV import options and outcomes

The frontend supports:

- A single text-based PDF, limited to 20 MB.
- A ZIP archive containing PDFs, limited to a 100 MB request.
- The built-in archive packaged at `backend/src/main/resources/intial/CVs.zip` for development and demonstration.

Each document receives one of these outcomes:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `IMPORTED` | Text was extracted and a candidate was created. |
| `DUPLICATE` | The same file content was imported previously; no duplicate candidate was created. |
| `NEEDS_REVIEW` | Too little usable text was extracted, commonly because OCR is required. |
| `SKIPPED` | The archive entry is unsupported or is not a PDF. |
| `FAILED` | Validation, extraction, or persistence failed for that entry. |

Candidate names are conservatively inferred from filenames and email addresses from extracted text. Review inferred metadata before relying on it. The application currently retains extracted text and document metadata, but not the original PDF binary.

## Run automated tests

The organization ownership model, isolation rules, and existing-database rollout procedure are documented in
[`specifications/tenant-isolation.md`](specifications/tenant-isolation.md).

Run backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
mvn test
```

Maven 3 and Java 21 must be available on the local `PATH`.

Run frontend tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm test -- --watch=false
```

The automated suites use mocked AI dependencies; an OpenAI API key is not required for these tests.

## Useful Docker commands

Follow application logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend frontend
```

Rebuild after source or dependency changes:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Restart the services without rebuilding:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

Stop and remove the application containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Stop the application and remove its database volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> `docker compose down -v` permanently deletes the local PostgreSQL data managed by this Compose project.

This includes approved jobs, candidates, CV document metadata and extracted text, and persisted evaluations.

## Troubleshooting

### A port is already allocated

Check which containers are using host ports:

```bash
docker ps
```

The default application ports are:

- `4200` for the frontend
- `8080` for the backend
- `5433` for PostgreSQL host access

Stop the conflicting application or update the corresponding host-side port in `docker-compose.yml`.

### The backend does not start

Inspect its logs:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail 200 backend
```

Confirm that:

- The `db` service is healthy.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists in the root `.env` file.
- Port `8080` is available.

### The frontend image fails with an esbuild platform mismatch

Ensure `frontend/.dockerignore` exists and excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.angular`. Host-generated dependencies must not be copied into the Linux image.
